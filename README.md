This is an application built in Javascript using Node.js and MongoDB for the database. Styling and pages were
created using HTML and CSS. A full list of technologies used can be found at the end of this document.

## About
This application is titled "Media Recommender," and serves as a platform for users to search for music and movies,
as well as create playlists of their favorites, or things to watch later. When creating an account, users input their
favorite music and movie genres. This, along with your playlists, allows the system to recommend new things to you,
which are available on your profile page, as well as through email notifications.

## Setup
-Be sure to have Node.js and MongoDB installed on your computer  
-Download or pull the master branch of this repository. In git, the command would be `git pull`
-Navigate to the media-recommender directory in the terminal
-Seed the database with some starter data with the command `node seed.js`

## Use
